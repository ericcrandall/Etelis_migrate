Analysis strategy is BAYESIAN INFERENCE
    - Population size estimation: Theta [Exponential Distribution]

Proposal distribution:

Inheritance multipliers in use for Thetas (specified # 1)
All inheritance multipliers are the same [1.000000]

Pseudo-random number generator: Mersenne-Twister                                
Random number seed (with internal timer)           2114692319

Start parameters:
   First genealogy was started using a random tree
   Start parameter values were generated
Connection matrix:
m = average (average over a group of Thetas or M,
s = symmetric migration M, S = symmetric 4Nm,
0 = zero, and not estimated,
* = migration free to vary, Thetas are on diagonal
d = row population split off column population
D = split and then migration
