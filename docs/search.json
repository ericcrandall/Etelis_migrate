    "text": "Introduction\nBrian Bowen’s student Ann Lee asked me to do a migrate analysis on two species of deepwater snapper, Etelis carbunculus and Etelis coruscans. She wrote:\n\nMy thesis focuses on assessing the population structure and origin of deepwater snappers, Etelis carbunculus and Etelis coruscans, that were sampled from Japan, Johnston Atoll, Main Hawaiian Islands, and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. My data consists of SNPs and I will be using migrate to help me with the analysis of the origin. This will help me examine the patterns of gene flow within both species to compare the Hawaiian populations to Johnston Atoll and Japan populations.\n\nBecause these guys are so deep down, and harder to sample, we just have single population samples from the four populations she mentions above.\n\n\n\n{#fig-alt=“Etelis carbunculus; photo by Thomas Schreiber}\n\n\n{#fig-alt=“Etelis coruscans; photo by Wiwied Soeparto}\n\n\n\n\nBee-utiful deepwater snappers wondering where they came from, where they are going, and whether they can get back in the water now.\n\n\n\nI’m also going to see how much I can learn about quarto notebooks, which Rstudio is apparently using to replace Rmarkdown notebooks. They seem like an improvement so far!"
